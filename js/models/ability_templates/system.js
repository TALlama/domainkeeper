    <p>üëë This is a simplified version of <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1739">Kingmaker 2E's Kingdom rules</a>. Skills, Feats, RP, Commodities, Consumption, Influence, and Roles are all removed.</p>
    <p>üìà The domain has four Abilities: Culture, Economy, Loyalty, and Stability. It also has four Stats: Unrest, Size, XP, Level. Build up the Ability scores and Stats by doing activities. Spend down the Ability scores to build stuff that helps your domain run and grow.</p>
    <p>üèôÔ∏è You start with one settlement, but can build more later. Each turn, every settlement does one activity. You roll one of the domain's Abilities to see how well the activity goes. Settlements can build Structures, which cost Ability points but offer a variety of long-term benefits.</p>
    <p>üë• The PCs are the leaders of the domain (they don't have specific roles). Each turn, every leader does two activities. You roll one of the domain's Abilities to see how well the activity goes. A leader can't take the same activity twice, and no two leaders can use the same ability for the same activity in a turn.</p>
    <p>‚ôªÔ∏è When all activities are complete, an event occurs (there's no roll; an event occurs every turn). You roll one of the Abilities to see how the event plays out. Then you'll start the next turn with a summary of what's changed.</p>
    <p>üéØ Your goal is to keep your Domain running and expanding. If any Ability drops to 0, the Domain will fall into Ruin and you lose control. Similarly, if Unrest ever climbs to 20, the Domain falls into Anarchy.</p>
    <p>üíæ Domains save at the end of every turn, or any time you hit the icon. Click üîÄ to manage your saves.</p>
